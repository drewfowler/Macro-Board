I designed a housing to hold some Cherry MX keys and a screen. I am going to use an Adafruit trinket to send key commands to the computer and then a ST7735R screen to display what keys do what. Autohotkey will handle the computer side.

I used a SparkFun Pro Micro  to handle the buttons.

I wrote simple firmware to implement the buttons as pressing SHIFT and then the functions keys. If you use Auto Hot Key, the possibilities are endless. I have included the Auto Hot Key script that I use for examples.
